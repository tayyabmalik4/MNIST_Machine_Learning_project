# (21)*****************************Handwritten Digit Recognition on MNIST Dataset in Machine Learning***********************

# ******What is MNIST?
# ---Set of 70000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau
# ---All images are labelled with the respective digit they represent
# ---MNIST is the hello world of machine learning
# ---There are 70000 images and each image has 784 features
# ---Each image is 28X28 pixels, and each feature simply represents one pic

# **************Agenda
# ----In the last tutorials we saw how to solve an ML problem end to end
# ----In this tutorial we will first fetch the data and then split it into train and test sets
# ----After that we will apply few ML algorithms to detect a given digit
